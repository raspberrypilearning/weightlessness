## Set the space scene

On Earth, **gravity** pulls everything and everybody down towards the ground. In space it feels like everything is floating because it is no longer being pulled by our planet’s gravity.

You will set up your weightlessness space game with a space backdrop and a space character.

Sprites are characters and objects in Scratch. Can you find a sprite that has already been included in your project? That’s Scratch the cat, but we need a sprite with an astronaut suit.

It takes astronauts on board <span style="color: #0faeb0">**The International Space Station**</span> some time to get used to the feeling of weightlessness. These [Weightlessness videos](https://www.stem.org.uk/elibrary/resource/29076){:target="_blank"} from NASA show how people and objects behave in space.
