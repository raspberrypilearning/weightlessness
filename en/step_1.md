## You will make

Create a Scratch game to simulate the effects of weightlessness in space. 

You will:

- Simulate weightlessness using a `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop and `point in direction`{:class="block3motion"} blocks
- Add and edit a 'Game Over' backdrop then `switch backdrop`{:class="block3looks"} using code
- Use the Scratch `timer`{:class="block3sensing"} variable and make your own `score variable`{:class="block3variables"} to create a game

### Play &#9654;

Click on the green flag in the top left corner to start the game. Click the left mouse button to the left of the astronaut to move left. You can move up, down, left or right. 

If you are on a tablet you can touch the Stage with your finger to move in the same way. 

How many times can you catch the space dog in 30 seconds?
